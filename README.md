## FLUID-CONTAINER
Hey! 
This is my first big React and Redux project🚀⚛
This project can show you how fluid can fill connected containers🥛
If you learn React too and know JS enough, I'll feel free to help me with 
this project and create some features😁
If you're react developer, please write me some advises, it will make me better💪🏻
Thank you!🦜
